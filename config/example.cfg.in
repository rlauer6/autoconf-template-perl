#
#  Don't forget to set the makevar variables in your Makefile.am (see below for information)
#
#  ...and as this project template does don't forget to place this:
#
#   @do_subst_command@ 
# 
#   ...somewhere in your Makefile.am It defines a sed command line
#   that does the substitutions in your .in file, replacing @SIS_XXX@,
#   etc, with the value of $XXX set in your Makefile.am as shown
#   below:
#                              
#    NAME_DB = @SIS_NAME_DB@
#    NAME_USERNAME = @SIS_NAME_USERNAME@
#    NAME_PASSWORD = @SIS_NAME_PASSWORD@
#
# Example of using the AM_CONDITIONAL (--enable-some-thingy) in your
# Makefile.am:
#    
#    if SOME_THINGY_ENABLED 
#       SOME_THINGY = on
#    else
#       SOME_THINGY = off
#    endif

[database]
db = @NAME_DB@
username = @NAME_USERNAME@
password = @NAME_PASSWORD@

[log]
level = info
path = @logdir@/foo.log

[option]
some_thingy @SOME_THINGY@

# --> use './configure --help' to see all the possible configuration
#     options and features available in this project template
#
# --> In general, the feature or option shown becomes available as an autoconf
#      variable in your Makefile.am as the capitalized version of the
#      token dropping the --with or --enable and by replacing the dash
#      ('-') with an underscore ('_')
#
#      Example: --with-sis-name-db ===> @SIS_NAME_DB@
#
#      In order to use this in your source files (.in), the sed
#      command that actually does the substitution during the 'make'
#      phase expects that you have created a makevar of the same name
#      without the SIS_ part in your Makefile.am.
#
#      Makefile.am: 
#
#      NAME_DB = @SIS_NAME_DB@
#
# Some possible assignments you may find useful in your Makefile.am:
#
# NAME_DB = @SIS_NAME_DB@ 
# NAME_USERNAME = @SIS_NAME_USERNAME@
# NAME_PASSWORD = @SIS_NAME_PASSWORD@

# OMS_DB = @SIS_OMS_DB@ 
# OMS_USERNAME = @SIS_OMS_USERNAME@
# OMS_PASSWORD = @SIS_OMS_PASSWORD@

# CDS_DB = @SIS_CDS_DB@ 
# CDS_USERNAME = @SIS_CDS_USERNAME@
# CDS_PASSWORD = @SIS_CDS_PASSWORD@

# ACCTN_DB = @SIS_ACCTN_DB@ 
# ACCTN_USERNAME = @SIS_ACCTN_USERNAME@
# ACCTN_PASSWORD = @SIS_ACCTN_PASSWORD@

# MARS_TAX_DB = @SIS_MARS_TAX_DB@ 
# MARS_TAX_USERNAME = @SIS_MARS_TAX_USERNAME@
# MARS_TAX_PASSWORD = @SIS_MARS_TAX_PASSWORD@

# GEO_DB = @SIS_GEO_DB@ 
# GEO_USERNAME = @SIS_GEO_USERNAME@
# GEO_PASSWORD = @SIS_GEO_PASSWORD@

# REPORTS_USERNAME = @SIS_REPORTS_USERNAME@
# REPORTS_PASSWORD = @SIS_REPORTS_PASSWORD@
